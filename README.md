# Inception

## Overview

Welcome to my Inception project repository! This project, completed as part of my studies at Hive Helsinki, focuses on designing and deploying a self-hosted, containerized infrastructure. Using Docker Compose on an Oracle Cloud-hosted virtual machine, this setup includes a fully functional WordPress site, secured with NGINX, and supported by MariaDB. Each component is configured for performance, isolation, and reliability.

## Project Structure

The project leverages Docker to create a small, isolated infrastructure with the following components:

- **NGINX**: Serves as the only entry point, handling HTTPS requests over TLS v1.2 or v1.3.
- **WordPress + PHP-FPM**: A containerized WordPress instance, optimized for performance, without a web server included to ensure modularity.
- **MariaDB**: Provides the database backend for WordPress, stored in a dedicated Docker volume.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for WordPress files and the MariaDB database.
- **Docker Network**: A private network ensuring secure communication between services.

## Features

- **Containerization with Docker Compose**: Each service runs in its dedicated container, designed with Alpine Linux for lightweight efficiency.
- **Security and Stability**: TLS-secured entry via NGINX, configured to restart containers automatically in case of failure.


## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
- **Domain Name**: Point your domain name to your VM’s public IP address.
- **Environment Variables**: Set environment variables in a `.env` file for credentials and configurations (details below).

## Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to manage sensitive information and configuration. A `.env.example` file is provided as a template. To use it:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp ./srcs/.env.example ./srcs/.env
   ```
2. Replace placeholder values in .env with your specific settings:

     ### Required Environment Variables

     **Database Credentials**:
     - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Root password for MySQL.
     - `MYSQL_USER`: MySQL user for WordPress.
     - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Password for the specified MySQL user.
     - `DB_NAME`: Database name for WordPress.
     - `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for accessing the WordPress database.
     - `DB_HOST`: Database host, typically `localhost` or the service name if in Docker, e.g., `mariadb`.

     **WordPress Site Configuration**:
     - `WP_SITE_TITLE`: (Optional) Title for the WordPress site.
     - `WP_USER`: Default WordPress user name.
     - `WP_PASSWORD`: Password for the default WordPress user.
     - `WP_EMAIL`: Email for the default WordPress user.
     - `WP_ADMIN_USER`: WordPress admin username.
     - `WP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password for the WordPress admin.
     - `WP_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Email for the WordPress admin.

     **WordPress Salts and Keys**:
     - Generate fresh values for each deployment using the [WordPress Salt Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) for improved security.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure environment variables (a dummy one is included for reference)
3. Build and run
     Use the `Makefile` to build the containers , it will create and start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml
5. Access the application
     `https://localhost:443`

## Repository Structure
```Plain text
.
├── Makefile            # Automates the build and setup process
├── docker-compose.yml  # Defines services, networks, and volumes
└── srcs
    ├── .env.example    # Template for environment variables
    ├── nginx           # NGINX configuration
    ├── wordpress       # WordPress configuration
    └── mariadb         # MariaDB configuration
```
## Project Details

- **NGINX**: Configured to serve traffic only over HTTPS with TLS v1.2 or v1.3.
- **WordPress**: Running with PHP-FPM, it is stored on a persistent volume to ensure data durability.
- **MariaDB**: A separate container with a dedicated volume to store the WordPress database, ensuring data persistence and reliability.
- **Restart Policies**: Containers are set to restart automatically, ensuring uptime and resilience in case of errors.


## Deployment

🚧 **Temporary Notice:**  
The Inception project is typically deployed on an Oracle Cloud virtual machine with a custom domain. However, due to a **temporary issue with Oracle Cloud account access**, the live demonstration at [portfolio.clerc.fi](https://portfolio.clerc.fi) is currently unavailable.  

This does not affect the project's reproducibility—by following the setup steps, you can deploy it on any compatible cloud or local infrastructure.


## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

- **Redis Caching**: Adding Redis to improve WordPress performance.
- **FTP Server**: Setting up an FTP server for direct access to WordPress files.
- **Automated Deployment**: Implementing automation for the deployment process on Oracle Cloud.

### Sample Automated Workflow

1. **Provision Infrastructure**: Use Terraform to automate resource provisioning.
2. **Configuration Management**: Automate instance and container setup with Ansible playbooks.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for streamlined deployment and updates.
4. **Container Deployment**: Deploy services using Docker Compose.
